Computer System
-Computer Architecture vs Computer Organization
-Examples of computer architecture and computer organization

Computer hierarchical nature (highest to lowest level)
-Structure
-Function

Function
-Data processing facility (storage only, storage and external environment)
-Data storage facility (short or long term)
-Data movement apparatus
-Control mechanism (involving all 4 operations)

Structure (Interaction with external environment))
-Peripheral devices
-Communication lines

Structure (Internal)
-CPU
-Main memory
-I/O(System bus)
-System interconnection

Structure (CPU)
-Control unit
-Arithmetic and logic unit(ALU)
-Registers
-CPU interconnection

History of Computers
-ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)- using vacuum tubes
-EDVAC(Electronic Discrete Variable Computer)
 -MBR
 -MAR
 -IR
 -IBR
 -PC
 -AC and MQ

-Transistor = smaller, cheaper, dissipates less heat
-IBM 7094 Configuration
 -Main different frm IAS computer is the use of data channels
 -Data channel
 -Multiplexor

-Integrated circuit
 -Gate for data processing 
 -Memory cells for data storage

-LSI, VLSI, ULSI (Scale integration)
 -Increase in no. of components per chip
 -Rings of ferromagnetic material (core) to semiconductor memory
 -Latest is the microprocesssor



Chapter 2 - Performance concept

-Microprocessor speed (Techniques for contemporary processors)
 -Pipelining
 -Branch prediction
 -Superscalar execution
 -Data flow analysis
 -Speculative execution

-Performance balance (to compensate for the mismatch among the 
 capabilities of various componenents
 -Increase the no. of bits by making DRAMs wider
 -Reduce the freq. of memory access
 -Change DRAM interface efficient by including cache
 -Increase the interconnect bandwidth btw processors and memory

-Handling of I/O devices

-Improvement in chip organization (To increase processor speed)
 -Increase hardware speed of processor
 -Increase size and speed of caches
 -Change processor organization and architecture

-Problems with clock speed and logic density
 -Power density ‚àù logic density and clock speed
 -RC delay
 -Memory access speed(latency) and transfer speed(throughput)
  lag processor speed

-Multicore (multiple processors on the same chip)
 -Increase performance without increasing the clock rate
 -Use two simpler processors rather than one complex processor
 -With two processors, caches are larger
 -As cache is larger, create more than one level of cache on a chip

-MIC(many integrated core) vs GPU(graphics processing unit)

-Clock system
 -Rate of pulses = clock rate / clock speed
 -One clock pulse = clock cycle / clock tick
 -Time btw pulses = cycle time

-Performance factors and system attributes

-Characteristics of a benchmark program
 -Written in high-level language and portable across different 
  machines
 -Representative of systems programming, numerical programming 
  or commercial programming
 -Can be measured easily
 -Has wide distribution
